/**
 * Human-readable, hype-toned release notes shown in the dedicated, screen-centered

 *
 * MAINTENANCE: this list is rewritten by the `/release` flow — see
 * `.gg/commands/release.md` (Track B). When cutting a desktop release, the diff
 * since the last `v*` tag is parsed and rephrased into exciting, non-technical

 * newest-first and the voice punchy — every line should make the update sound
 * worth installing, never a dry technical note.

      "I do not guess and I do not just nod along. When I size up your code or a plan I actually go check it. I search real shipping repos and read the live docs before I answer, and if something smells unverified I dig in and tell you what I found.",
