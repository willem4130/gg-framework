I've been writing code since before the AI wave hit. Been using Claude Code since release, and have gone through just about every coding agent out there since early 2024. I know what works and what's just overhead.

Claude Code is great. I use it daily. But after enough time with it, you notice how much baggage it carries. ~15,000 tokens of system prompt on every single request. The Claude Agent SDK does the same thing since it's Claude Code under the hood.

GG Coder is what happens when you strip all of that out and keep only what actually matters.

---

## The system prompt problem

Every token in the system prompt gets processed on **every single turn**. It's not a one-time cost. It's a tax on every request.

| | **Claude Code / Agent SDK** | **GG Coder** |
|---|---|---|
| System prompt size | ~15,000 tokens | **~1,100 tokens** |
| Ratio | baseline | **~13x smaller** |

### Why you should care

- **Slower responses.** More input tokens = longer time-to-first-token. In a 30-turn session, that wait adds up to minutes.
- **Worse instruction following.** More rules = more things the model ignores. "Lost in the middle" is well-documented. A 1,100 token prompt gets read. A 15,000 token one gets skimmed.
- **Context fills up faster.** ~15,000 tokens sitting in your window permanently. That's ~7.5% of a 200K model gone before you say hello. You hit compaction sooner, lose history faster, and the agent forgets what it was doing.
- **Higher cost.** Input tokens aren't free. Every cache miss charges you for the full bloat. Smaller prompt = smaller bill.

GG Coder sends only what the model needs: how to work, what tools it has, and your project context. No walls of rules. No formatting instructions. Just signal.

---

## The MCP problem

Same philosophy applies to tools. People collect MCPs like Pokemon. Slack MCP, GitHub MCP, Notion MCP, five different file system MCPs. Every single one injects its tool descriptions into the context. The model now has to figure out which of 40+ tools to use for any given task.

This doesn't help. It confuses the agent. More tool descriptions = more noise = worse tool selection. The model spends tokens reasoning about tools it will never call.

GG Coder ships with one MCP: [Grep](https://grep.app). That's it. It lets the agent search across 1M+ public GitHub repos to verify implementations against real-world code. Correct API usage, library idioms, production patterns. One tool that actually makes the output better.

You can still add your own MCPs if you need them. But start with less. You'll get better results.

## Four providers, one agent

Switch mid-conversation with `/model`. Not locked to anyone.

| Provider | Models | Auth |
|---|---|---|
| **Anthropic** | Claude Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6, Haiku 4.5 | OAuth |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4.1, o3, o4-mini | OAuth |
| **Z.AI (GLM)** | GLM-5, GLM-4.7 | API key |
| **Moonshot** | Kimi K2.5 | API key |

OAuth for Anthropic and OpenAI (log in once, auto-refresh). API keys for GLM and Moonshot. Up and running in seconds either way.

---

## Slash commands

Everything runs through slash commands inside the session. Not CLI flags.

```bash
/model claude-opus-4-6       # Switch models on the fly
/model kimi-k2.5
/compact                      # Compress context when it gets long

# Built-in workflows
/scan          # Dead code, bugs, security issues (5 parallel agents)
/verify        # Verify against docs and best practices (8 parallel agents)
/research      # Research best tools and patterns for your stack
/init          # Generate CLAUDE.md for your project
/setup-lint    # Generate a /fix command for your stack
/setup-commit  # Generate a /commit command with quality checks
/setup-tests   # Set up testing + generate /test
/setup-update  # Generate an /update command for deps
```

---

## Custom commands

Drop a markdown file in `.gg/commands/` and it becomes a slash command.

```markdown
---
name: deploy
description: Build, test, and deploy to production
---

1. Run the test suite
2. Build for production
3. Deploy using the project's deploy script
4. Verify the deployment is healthy
```

Now `/deploy` works in that project. Your React app gets `/deploy` and `/storybook`. Your API gets `/migrate` and `/seed`. Different projects, different commands.

---

## Skills

Reusable behaviors across projects. Drop `.md` files in:

- `~/.gg/skills/` for global skills (available everywhere)
- `.gg/skills/` for project-specific skills

They get loaded into the system prompt automatically. The agent knows what it can do without you explaining it each session.

---

## Project guidelines

Drop a `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` in your repo root (or any parent directory). GG Coder picks it up automatically.

Your rules. Your conventions. The agent follows them.

---

## Getting started

```bash
npm i -g @kenkaiiii/ggcoder
```

1. `ggcoder login`
2. Pick your provider
3. Authenticate
4. `ggcoder`

That's it.

---

## Usage

```bash
ggcoder
```

Type `/help` inside a session to see everything available.

## The packages

Three npm packages. Use them together or separately.

| Package | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`@kenkaiiii/gg-ai`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kenkaiiii/gg-ai) | Unified streaming API across all four providers |
| [`@kenkaiiii/gg-agent`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kenkaiiii/gg-agent) | Agent loop with multi-turn tool execution |
| [`@kenkaiiii/ggcoder`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kenkaiiii/ggcoder) | The full CLI |

### Streaming API

```typescript
import { stream } from "@kenkaiiii/gg-ai";

for await (const event of stream({
  provider: "anthropic",
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-6",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }],
})) {
  if (event.type === "text_delta") process.stdout.write(event.text);
}
```

### Agent loop

```typescript
import { Agent } from "@kenkaiiii/gg-agent";
import { z } from "zod";

const agent = new Agent({
  provider: "moonshot",
  model: "kimi-k2.5",
  system: "You are a helpful assistant.",
  tools: [{
    name: "get_weather",
    description: "Get the weather for a city",
    parameters: z.object({ city: z.string() }),
    async execute({ city }) {
      return { temperature: 72, condition: "sunny" };
    },
  }],
});

for await (const event of agent.prompt("What's the weather in Tokyo?")) {
  // text_delta, tool_call_start, tool_call_end, agent_done, etc.
}
```

---

## For developers

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KenKaiii/gg-framework.git
cd gg-framework
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

TypeScript 5.9 + pnpm workspaces + Ink 6 + React 19 + Vitest 4 + Zod v4
