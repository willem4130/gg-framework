### Minor Changes

- Update system prompt talk section for ADHD-readable responses

  Rewrite `renderTalkSection()` so every reply leads with the outcome word
  (Fixed/Done/Broken/Failed), enforces bottom-line-first scanning, one idea
  per line, pick-don't-menu, concrete metrics, no unresolved it-depends, and
  affirmative phrasing. Designed for fast scanning and low working memory.

## 4.12.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix Windows sidecar crash: the session-folder name encoder (`encodeCwd`) now strips Windows extended-length path prefixes (`\\?\` and `\\?\UNC\`) and all reserved filename characters (`<>:"|?*`). Previously, Windows canonicalized cwds (`\\?\C:\Users\brams`) produced illegal folder names containing `?`, causing `mkdir` ENOENT and a fatal sidecar crash on startup — blocking OAuth/login for all Windows users.

### Minor Changes

- Add generate_image tool: generate and edit images via OpenAI gpt-image-2 through the Codex backend. Conditionally registered when OpenAI is connected. Includes inline image preview in transcript, shimmering skeleton placeholder during generation, 1:1 history reconstruction for tool-produced images and sub-agent groups on session resume, and image path exposure for multi-turn editing.

### Minor Changes

- Update Kimi to K2.7 (`kimi-k2.7-code`) as the Moonshot default model, replacing Kimi K2.6 across the registry, CLI, login UI, and docs.

  Harden Kimi OAuth token refresh so it no longer silently falls back to a paid Moonshot API key: refresh reuses the existing refresh token when the server doesn't rotate it, tokens are renewed proactively before expiry (60s skew), `baseUrl` is preserved across refreshes, and a genuinely-dead OAuth credential now logs a warning instead of switching billing silently.

### Patch Changes

- Fix OpenAI OAuth account switching by adding prompt=login to authorize URL. Previously, re-running `ggcoder login` with OpenAI would silently re-approve the cached browser session, preventing users from switching accounts.
