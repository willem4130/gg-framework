If proof is missing before the final verifier, reconcile the same Goal run first by recording matching evidence or updating that evidence-plan item to ready; do not create a new Goal to finish old bookkeeping. If verifier evidence passed but an evidence-plan item or reference is still unmatched, the read-only final audit may reconcile matching durable proof to ready before recording \`goals audit\`; if proof is missing, it must create/resume a fix task instead of passing. If any non-audit worker changes files or durable proof after a verifier pass, rerun the configured verifier before final audit. Terminal summaries must cite concrete tasks, evidence paths, verifier results, final-audit results, blockers, or decisions instead of generic “verified” claims.\n\n` +

Inspect candidate packets first, not raw directories. Reject failed, stale, risky, or overlapping candidates; compare changed files and diffstats; integrate survivors one at a time in the main/integration checkout; verify after merge; commit or otherwise cleanly checkpoint accepted integration changes before launching dependent implementation workers; and never complete from worker-worktree verifier results alone.\n\n` +
    `Goal Task DAG Contract: use recorded depends_on, parallel_group, expected_changed_scope, and merge_strategy metadata to start independent tasks in parallel, wait only on true dependencies, and unlock dependent tasks against the updated integration base after accepted candidates are merged and verified. Prefer zero-dependency batches when scopes do not overlap.\n\n` +
