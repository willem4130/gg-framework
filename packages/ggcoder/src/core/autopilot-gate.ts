/**
 * Autopilot gate — pure decision logic for whether Ken's auto-review cycle may
 * start after a finished GG Coder turn.
 *
 * Autopilot must NOT review every turn. The concrete leak cases this gate
 * closes (each has a matching unit test in autopilot-gate.test.ts):
 *
 * - Workflow slash commands (`/compare`, `/bullet-proof`, `/expand`, custom
 *   `.gg/commands/*.md`) end with reports or A/B/C choices that are reserved
 *   for the USER. Ken reviewing them reads "findings" as "something real is
 *   wrong" and injects fix prompts the user never approved.
 * - Registry commands (`/help`, `/session`, unknown `/foo`) and failed runs
 *   add no assistant work at all — a review would judge the PREVIOUS turn
 *   again (Ken's cycle memory is wiped per turn) and can flip a settled
 *   ALL_CLEAR into a fresh PROMPT.
 * - A turn that ended in plan mode has a pending Accept/Reject modal; Ken must
 *   never inject a prompt into a read-only plan-mode session.
 * - A turn whose ONLY tool calls were mechanical usage — a bash command that
 *   starts a background process (dev server, watcher), is read-only, or is a
 *   plain `git add`/`commit`/`push` workflow; a dedicated read-only tool
 *   (read/grep/find/ls/web_fetch/web_search/source_path/code_search/
 *   task_output/screenshot/skill); or NO tool calls at all (a plain-text
 *   answer with nothing built) — was always going to come back as Ken's
 *   IGNORE verdict (see the autopilot system prompt's "mechanical operation"
 *   / "plain question answered with no code touched" rules). Pre-filtering
 *   these skips the review API call entirely instead of paying for one whose
 *   answer is already known.
 *
 * Kept pure + dependency-light so it's unit-testable without booting the
 * sidecar (which runs `main()` at import time).
