    prompt: `# Expand: Current Competitive Gap Review

Find high-value gaps by comparing this project to similar, adjacent, and best-in-class repositories/tools/websites/services. This command is project-agnostic: infer what THIS project is before choosing comparisons. This command is report-first: do not edit, install, or implement anything until the user chooses an option at the end.

## Phase 0: Profile this project first

Before external research, inspect the local project and write a private working profile:

- What the project does, who it serves, and how it ships/runs.
- Core workflows, entrypoints, packages/modules, integrations, and user-facing surfaces.
- Existing features, security controls, developer tooling, docs, tests, release/ops setup, and architecture patterns.
- The most relevant comparison categories for THIS project. Do not assume this is an AI-agent app unless the repo proves it.

Use this profile to decide what kinds of external projects are relevant. If the user passed arguments to /expand, treat them as a focus area and prioritize that lens while still validating project relevance.

## Phase 1: Parallel expansion research

Spawn exactly 5 sub-agents in parallel using the subagent tool (call the subagent tool 5 times in a single response). Give each sub-agent the project profile and a different comparison lens. Adapt the lenses to the project, but cover these defaults unless clearly irrelevant:

**Agent 1 - Direct peers & product features**: Find actively maintained projects/tools/services closest to this project. Look for user-facing capabilities, workflows, integrations, onboarding, and monetizable/retention-driving features they have that this project lacks.

**Agent 2 - Security, privacy & recent incidents**: Find recent security/privacy hardening, dependency ecosystem changes, advisories, exploit mitigations, auth/session patterns, sandboxing, supply-chain defenses, and issue/PR fixes from comparable projects that this project should consider.

**Agent 3 - Architecture, code quality & implementation shape**: Compare code organization, APIs, extensibility, agent/runtime loops, data models, concurrency, error handling, configuration, plugin systems, and maintainability patterns. Include cleaner implementation ideas only when they produce concrete user/developer value.

**Agent 4 - Developer experience, ops & release maturity**: Compare tests, CI/CD, docs, examples, templates, telemetry/observability, migrations, upgrade paths, packaging, installation, local dev, debugging, and support workflows.

**Agent 5 - Ecosystem, trends & adjacent inspiration**: Look beyond direct peers to adjacent current tools, libraries, SaaS products, standards, RFCs, framework releases, and recent commits/releases that suggest important missing directions.

Each sub-agent must:

1. Use current sources: prefer repos/releases/commits/docs/articles updated within the last 6 months. Drop old or stale sources unless they are canonical and still actively maintained.
2. Return only candidates that appear absent or materially weaker in this project.
3. Include source names/URLs, freshness date (commit/release/article/doc date), and the local search anchors they used or recommend to verify absence.
4. Separate findings into useful categories for the final report, such as Security, Product, Architecture, Developer Experience, Operations, or Ecosystem.
5. Avoid generic wishlist items. Every candidate must be grounded in an external comparison and relevant to this project profile.

## Phase 2: Main-agent validation against this repo

For every candidate from the sub-agents, validate it yourself before reporting:

1. Confirm the external source is relevant to this project and fresh enough (normally within 6 months).
2. Search this repo with grep/find and language-aware anchors to check whether the feature/pattern/control already exists under another name.
3. Check manifests, docs, configs, package exports, routes, CLI commands, tests, CI, examples, and framework conventions before calling something missing.
4. Use mcp__kencode-search__searchCode when code-level comparison would clarify whether the external implementation is materially cleaner or more complete. Use literal imports, functions, config keys, CLI flags, route names, or package names — not conceptual phrases.
5. Drop anything already present, not applicable, too vague, too stale, or unsupported by evidence.
6. Keep the report short: prioritize the highest-value gaps over completeness.

## What counts as a reportable gap

Report only gaps that are:

- **Missing capability**: A relevant current peer has a feature, integration, workflow, or user-facing behavior this project lacks.
- **Security/privacy hardening**: A current source addressed a meaningful risk this project has not addressed.
- **Operational maturity**: A relevant project has CI, release, observability, packaging, migration, or support practices this project lacks.
- **Developer experience**: A relevant project has docs, examples, tests, debugging, local dev, extension points, or generated commands that would materially improve this project.
- **Implementation quality**: A comparable codebase handles a shared concern more simply, safely, extensibly, or robustly, and this repo lacks that pattern.
- **Ecosystem alignment**: A recent framework/API/standard/release changed expectations and this project has not caught up.

Do not report:

- Ideas not tied to a real current source.
- Things this repo already has, even if named differently.
- Stale comparisons with no activity in the last 6 months unless canonical and still relevant.
- Pure taste or style preferences.
- Massive rewrites unless there is a specific incremental gap to implement.
- Low-confidence guesses.

## Priority levels

- **P0**: Critical gap: security exposure, data loss risk, broken compatibility, major missing core workflow, or urgent ecosystem change.
- **P1**: High-value gap: important feature/hardening/DX/ops improvement with strong external evidence and clear fit.
- **P2**: Useful gap: meaningful but not urgent, or requires a scoped design decision before implementation.
- **P3**: Exploratory gap: promising but lower confidence or lower immediate impact. Use sparingly.

## Final output

Output separate category sections only for categories with findings. No prose before the first section. Each section must use a table with exactly these 3 columns:

| Repo/tool/source | Feature or gap | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| name + fresh date | concise gap, evidence, and why this repo lacks it | P0/P1/P2/P3 |

Rules:

- The table must have exactly 3 columns. Put source URL/date/evidence and local absence proof inside the first two cells, not extra columns.
- Sort rows by priority within each category: P0, then P1, then P2, then P3.
- Keep each cell concise but specific enough to be actionable.
- If no validated gaps are found, output one table row saying no fresh validated gaps were found.
- Do not include implementation prose after the tables except the options below.

After the tables, ask exactly:

What should I do?
A) Create a Goal for all P0/P1 gaps
B) Create a Goal for only the top priority gap from each category
C) Skip

Do not start implementing until the user chooses.

If the user chooses A or B, do not implement gaps directly. Instead, create one durable Goal with one implementation worker task per selected gap, ordered by dependency and priority.

Each worker prompt must be standalone and include:

1. The specific gap, including relevant local files/anchors and source evidence from the /expand report.
2. Instructions to compare the implementation approach with kencode search before editing, using literal code tokens and current real-world examples.
3. Instructions to implement the gap in the local codebase.
4. Instructions to verify correctness after implementation by running project checks and by comparing the final implementation with kencode search again before marking the Goal task complete.

Do not create planning-only Goal tasks, do not instruct workers to use planning-only workflows, and do not create or write implementation plans from /expand selections.

After creating the Goal, tell the user exactly: "Goal created. Press CTRL + G to open the Goal pane and run it." Do not begin executing it unless the user explicitly starts the Goal.`,

    description: "Audit exploitable weaknesses",
    prompt: `# Bullet-Proof: Defensive Security Review

You are a defensive security auditor reviewing this codebase to identify exploitable weaknesses so they can be patched before the project ships. Think rigorously about realistic threat scenarios — boundary checks, edge cases, race conditions, trust assumptions, supply-chain risks, agent-mediated paths.

Goal: harden this project against realistic threats. **Report only HIGH CONFIDENCE findings (≥0.8) with a concrete data-flow path that demonstrates exposure.** Better to miss theoretical issues than flood the report with noise.

This command is **dynamic and project-agnostic**. Recon drives everything. Do not assume the stack, the language, the deploy target, or that there is an LLM/agent layer. Read first, decide second.

## Phase 1: Recon — Understand THIS project before auditing anything

Spawn **FOUR recon subagents in parallel** using the subagent tool (call the subagent tool 4 times in a single response). Each has a narrow, independent slice so they can all run at once. **No vulnerabilities flagged in this phase.**

**Recon Agent A — Stack & Deployment.** Read manifests, lockfiles, CI/CD configs, Dockerfile/Helm/Terraform, deploy scripts. Produce:
- Primary language(s), framework(s), runtimes
- Deploy target (browser / server / CLI / mobile / desktop / embedded / cloud function / container / serverless / smart contract / firmware / ML pipeline / library / SaaS / self-hosted)
- How it ships (npm/PyPI/cargo/go modules/app store/binary/Docker image/Helm chart/Terraform)
- Where it runs (which cloud/host, multi-tenant or single-tenant, network topology if discernible)

**Recon Agent B — Trust Boundaries & Sources.** Walk entry-point code (route handlers, CLI argparse, queue consumers, WebSocket handlers, IPC receivers, MCP server handlers, file/env readers, deserialization entry, plugin loaders). Produce:
- **Trust boundaries table** — every place untrusted data crosses into the system
- **Sources table** — for each entry point: location (file:line), input shape, who controls it (anonymous / authenticated user / admin / other service / build-time / env)

**Recon Agent C — Sinks.** Walk dangerous-operation code. Produce a **Sinks table** with location (file:line) and sink type for: shell exec, SQL / NoSQL / LDAP / XPath queries, eval / Function / exec / pickle / yaml.load / Marshal / ObjectInputStream, file write, file include / require with dynamic path, network egress (fetch / requests / http.Get), auth decisions, secret reads, native deserializers, dynamic code load, smart-contract external calls, child_process spawns.

**Recon Agent D — Assets.** Scan for what is worth stealing or destroying. Produce an **Assets table** with location and asset type for: credentials / tokens (config files, env files, KMS, OAuth flows, ~/.{app}/auth.json-style stores), customer/PII data stores, source code with IP value, build/CI secrets, signing keys, model API tokens, on-chain funds / wallets, session state, MCP config files, license keys.

**After all four return, the main agent synthesizes:**
1. Assemble the four tables (Stack/Deploy, Sources, Sinks, Assets) into the recon report
2. Add the **Threat model** — concrete to THIS project, derived from the four agents' outputs. Who would realistically target it and what for? (Examples: supply-chain risks affecting downstream users of a library; multi-tenant abuse on a SaaS; untrusted user input on a CLI/mobile app; insider risk with repo access; phishing-based account takeover; coding-agent risks from injected web content; on-chain reentrancy risks for a smart contract.) Be specific.
3. Note any obvious gaps the four recon agents flagged (areas that need a deeper look in Phase 3)

## Phase 2: Plan the audit — recon drives this

From the recon output, decide which vulnerability classes apply to THIS project. **Skip audits with no entry surface.** A static documentation site does not get a SQLi audit. A Rust embedded firmware project does not get a prompt-injection audit. A Python ML pipeline does get pickle/yaml audits. A library that ships to others gets supply-chain weighted heavily.

Default catalog — pick what applies, drop what doesn't, add stack-specific audits where recon shows a unique surface:

| Audit | Fires when | Audits for |
|---|---|---|
| **Injection** | unsanitized input reaches an interpreter | SQLi, command injection, template injection, eval/Function/exec, pickle/yaml.load, NoSQL/LDAP/XPath injection, prompt injection |
| **AuthN/AuthZ/Session** | any auth, session, or access-control logic exists | broken access control (IDOR, BOLA), JWT alg confusion / alg:none, OAuth state/PKCE/redirect-uri abuse, session fixation, missing rate limit on credential checks, MFA bypass, TOCTOU races |
| **Secrets & exposure paths** | any secret/credential/token exists | hardcoded keys, logs/errors/debug-file leakage, source maps in published artifacts, telemetry leakage, prototype pollution exposing secrets, \`JSON.stringify(err)\` shapes, env dump in error pages, exposed \`.git\`/\`.env\`/\`.map\` |
| **Supply chain** | any dependency manager or external code | unpinned deps/actions, postinstall scripts, typosquats, **slopsquats (AI-hallucinated package names registered by malicious parties)**, dependency confusion, lockfile drift, install-time \`curl \\| sh\`, unsigned releases, unverified maintainer takeovers, self-spreading worms (Shai-Hulud family) |
| **CI/CD & build integrity** | any CI workflow, release pipeline | \`pull_request_target\` + checkout of PR HEAD (Pwn Request), Actions cache poisoning, OIDC token theft from \`/proc\`, self-hosted runner reuse, secret echoes, missing \`permissions:\` block |
| **SSRF, path traversal, file ops** | any URL/path/file built from input | SSRF to metadata endpoints (IMDSv1), path traversal, zip-slip, symlink races, unrestricted upload, archive extraction outside target dir |
| **Cloud/infra & misconfig** | any IaC, container, cloud SDK use | overpermissive IAM (\`Action:*\`, \`iam:PassRole:*\`), public buckets, IMDSv1, exposed K8s API/kubelet, presigned URLs without expiry, default creds, debug endpoints in prod, CORS \`origin:*\` + \`credentials:true\` |
| **Crypto** | any crypto/hashing/signing | weak algos (MD5/SHA1 for auth), missing IV, ECB mode, hardcoded keys, JWT \`alg:none\`, non-constant-time compare on secrets, predictable PRNG for tokens |
| **Agent surface** | only if recon detected LLM/AI/MCP/coding-agent/tool-calling code | indirect prompt injection via fetched content, MCP tool poisoning, tool-description injection (ToolLeak), system-prompt exposure via tool args, **Rules-File Backdoor (Unicode bidi / zero-width chars hiding instructions in CLAUDE.md / .cursorrules / AGENTS.md)**, malicious CLAUDE.md walking up parent dirs, DNS-exfil via coerced tool calls, RAG / memory / context poisoning, vector-store embedding risks |
| **Dangerous-sink dataflow (taint)** | Sources × Sinks tables are non-empty | trace each Source through the codebase to every reachable Sink; flag reachable paths with no sanitization between |

**Add stack-specific audits when recon surfaces them**: smart-contract reentrancy/oracle manipulation; mobile IPC / deep links / pasteboard / WebView \`addJavascriptInterface\`; embedded firmware update integrity, debug interfaces left enabled; ML model deserialization, training-data poisoning, MLflow/Triton config exposure.

## Phase 3: Parallel audits

Spawn one subagent per active audit **in a single response** (call the subagent tool N times **with \`agent: "auditor"\`**, where N is whatever Phase 2 picked — do not pad to a fixed number, do not drop audits Phase 2 selected). The \`auditor\` agent has the defensive-review persona and exclusion list baked in, so your task description only needs the vulnerability-class scope. Each auditor receives:
- The full recon output (Sources, Sinks, Assets, Threat model)
- Its specific vulnerability-class scope
- The 2026 threat reference at the bottom of this prompt

Each auditor must:
1. **Trace data flow** from Sources to Sinks for its class. Not pattern matching.
2. For every candidate, apply the **untrusted-input vs trusted-input** decision: is the input *actually reachable* by an untrusted source, or is it a settings constant / build-time string / hard-coded value?
3. Construct a concrete **vulnerability scenario** — describe how the weakness would be triggered (input → system response → resulting exposure). If you can't describe the steps, don't flag it.
4. Assign **confidence 0.0–1.0**. Drop anything <0.8 before returning.
5. Be framework-aware: ORM parameterization, auto-escape, memory-safe languages, JSX/template escaping all eliminate entire vuln classes. Don't flag what the framework already handles.

## Phase 4: False-positive filter

After auditors complete, spawn one verification subagent per surviving finding **in parallel with \`agent: "skeptic"\`** (call the subagent tool once per finding in a single response). The \`skeptic\` agent starts from "this is a false positive" and tries to disprove the finding — only confirmed findings survive. Pass each verifier the full audit finding (location, source/sink, vulnerability scenario, claimed confidence). Drop anything the skeptic returns as DROP; lower severity for DOWNGRADE.

**Hard exclusions — do NOT report these, even if real:**
- DOS / rate-limiting / memory exhaustion without a clear amplification primitive
- Theoretical race conditions without a demonstrable trigger window
- Regex-DOS without untrusted-supplied regex
- Log spoofing / log injection (cosmetic)
- SSRF where the URL is a settings constant or build-time string
- Env-var trust (env is server-controlled by definition)
- Client-side authentication theatre on a server-validated endpoint
- React/Angular/Vue XSS in non-unsafe-sink paths (\`dangerouslySetInnerHTML\`, \`v-html\`, \`bypassSecurityTrust*\` are the only real ones)
- Shell-script command injection without an untrusted input path
- Findings in documentation files, example code, or test fixtures
- Insecure-by-design dev tooling that doesn't ship to users
- "Could be improved" style preferences or hardening-best-practice nudges with no demonstrable path

## Phase 5: Report

Output one report. No code edits in this phase.

# Bullet-Proof Report — [Project name from recon]
Date: [today's date]
Threat model: [from recon]

## Exposure Surface Summary
[1-paragraph summary of the project's realistic exposure profile and where untrusted data enters]

## Sources / Sinks / Assets
[Compact tables from recon]

## Risk Matrix
| Severity | Count | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| Critical | N | RCE, full auth bypass, credential theft, fund loss |

- Location: path:line
- Category: <slug>   CWE: CWE-XXX   Confidence: 0.95
- Exposure surface: <entry point from Sources>
- Source → Sink: <e.g. \`POST /api/foo body.userId\` → \`subprocess.run(..., shell=True)\`>
- Vulnerability scenario:
  1. Untrusted input <specific payload> reaches <source>
  2. Server processes it as <what>
  3. Result: <RCE / data exposure / auth bypass>
- Impact: <blast radius — what is exposed, how far it spreads>
- Fix: <concrete remediation, code-level>

[…repeat per finding, ordered Critical → High → Medium…]

## What was not flagged
[1-paragraph: which vulnerability classes returned zero findings, and how many findings the FP filter dropped — so the user sees the work, not just the survivors]
\`\`\`

## Phase 6: Ask before fixing

After the report, ask:

> Which (if any) should I fix? Options:
> - A) Create a Goal for all Critical + High
> - B) Create a Goal for specific findings (give IDs, e.g. "BP-001, BP-004")
> - C) Create a Goal for a category (auth, supply chain, secrets, …)
> - D) None — report only

**Do not start fixing until the user picks.**

If the user chooses A, B, or C, do not fix directly. Instead, create one durable Goal with one worker task per selected finding or tightly coupled finding group, ordered by severity, exploitability, and dependency. Each worker prompt must include the finding ID, vulnerability scenario, affected local files/anchors, concrete remediation, instructions to compare security-sensitive implementation details with kencode search or authoritative docs before editing, project verification commands, and instructions to compare the final fix with kencode search or authoritative docs again before marking the Goal task complete. After creating the Goal, tell the user exactly: "Goal created. Press CTRL + G to open the Goal pane and run it." Do not begin executing it unless the user explicitly starts the Goal.

- GitGuardian 2026 — 28.6M GitHub secret leaks in 2025, 24k inside MCP config files

**Language-specific hot zones — only apply to languages actually present:**
- **Node/TS**: \`child_process.exec\`/\`execSync\`, \`spawn(..., {shell:true})\`, \`eval\`/\`Function\`, \`vm.runIn*\`, prototype pollution via \`lodash.merge\`/\`Object.assign({}, userJson)\`, \`serialize-javascript\`/\`node-serialize\`, source maps in published packages

- **Go**: \`exec.Command("sh", "-c", userInput)\`, \`html/template\` vs \`text/template\` confusion, unbounded \`io.ReadAll\`, race-prone \`map\` access without lock
- **Rust**: \`unsafe\` blocks with raw pointers, \`Command::new("sh").arg("-c")\`, deserializing untrusted \`bincode\`/\`serde_pickle\`/\`serde_json\` with \`#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]\` missing
- **Java/JVM**: \`ObjectInputStream\` deserialization, JNDI lookup (Log4Shell-style), \`Runtime.exec(String)\`, XXE in default XML parsers

- **Solidity / EVM**: reentrancy, unchecked external calls, integer over/underflow (pre-0.8), \`tx.origin\` for auth, delegatecall to untrusted, oracle manipulation
- **Mobile (iOS/Android)**: insecure IPC / deep links / pasteboard, WebView \`addJavascriptInterface\`, exported activities/intents without permission checks, insecure local storage

## Rules

- **Recon first, audits second.** No audit fires without a recon-identified entry surface to justify it.
- **No pattern-only findings.** Every flag must have a Sources → Sinks path traced through the code.
- **No "could be improved" recommendations.** Either it's exploitable or it's not in scope.
- **Strict confidence gate (≥0.8).** Drop everything else, even if it looks suspicious.
- **Adapt to the stack, always.** The audit catalog and threat reference above are guidance, not a checklist to apply uniformly.
- **Report only.** Wait for the user to pick what to fix in Phase 6.`,

    description: "Generate or update CLAUDE.md for this project",
    prompt: `Generate or update a minimal CLAUDE.md with project-specific context only: what this project is, how it is structured, and commands/workflows that are unique to it.

Do NOT add generic agent behavior already covered by the system prompt, including: read before edit/write, re-read after formatters, ask before destructive actions, no fake verification, generic code-quality advice, single-responsibility rules, one-file-per-component rules, or language-style conventions. Never add guidance that requires running checks, builds, or the full quality suite after every edit or every file change. Include only project-specific overrides or stricter local requirements.

## Step 1: Check if CLAUDE.md Exists

If CLAUDE.md exists:
- Read the existing file
- Preserve custom sections the user may have added
- Update only project-specific facts that are stale or missing
- Remove generic guidance that is already covered by the system prompt unless it is a deliberate project-specific override

If CLAUDE.md does NOT exist:
- Create a new one from scratch

## Step 2: Analyze Project (Use Sub-agents in Parallel)

Derive every fact from the actual project — source code, entry points, manifests, and config. Treat README, docs, and code comments as unverified hints that are frequently stale: never copy claims from them, and only state things you can confirm from the code and config themselves.

Spawn 3 sub-agents in parallel using the subagent tool (call the subagent tool 3 times in a single response):

1. **Project Purpose Agent**: Determine what the project actually does from its real code — entry points, main modules, exported/public APIs, CLI commands, routes, and manifests. Do not rely on the README's description.
2. **Directory Structure Agent**: Map out the folder structure and what each folder contains
3. **Tech Stack Agent**: Identify languages, frameworks, tools, and dependencies from manifests/lockfiles and config (not from prose docs)

Wait for all sub-agents to complete, then synthesize the information.

## Step 3: Detect Project Type & Commands

Check for config files:
- package.json -> JavaScript/TypeScript (extract package-manager, build, lint, typecheck, test, format, and server scripts)
- pyproject.toml or requirements.txt -> Python
- go.mod -> Go
- Cargo.toml -> Rust

Extract exact commands that are useful project facts. Take commands from authoritative sources — package scripts, manifests, Makefiles, and CI config; do not invent them from convention, and do not trust README/doc command snippets unless a script or manifest confirms they still exist. Do not restate generic "run checks after edits" behavior, and do not turn discovered commands into mandatory after-every-edit requirements unless local docs or CI explicitly require that stricter sequence.

## Step 4: Summarize Stable Structure

If useful, create a concise structure summary for future agents showing only key stable directories and files with brief descriptions. Do NOT embed generated symbol maps, exhaustive file indexes, auto-generated directory listings, or large trees in CLAUDE.md.

## Step 5: Generate or Update CLAUDE.md

Create CLAUDE.md with only sections that add project-specific value. Prefer this structure:

- Project name and one-sentence purpose
- Key packages/apps/modules and what each owns
- Important project-specific architecture or workflow notes
- Exact local commands (install/build/check/test/dev/publish/deploy) when they are not obvious from package scripts alone
- Project-specific constraints that override defaults (for example required publish order, generated-file workflow, auth/secrets storage, deployment caveats)

Avoid generic sections named "Code Quality", "Organization Rules", or "How to Work" unless every bullet is specific to this project. Do not duplicate language style packs, generic verification rules, or boilerplate quality gates such as "After editing ANY file" / "Code Quality — Zero Tolerance". Do not add symbol indexes, exhaustive file indexes, or auto-generated project inventories; CLAUDE.md must remain durable, agent-focused project context.

Keep total file under 100 lines. If updating, preserve any custom sections the user added. After writing, re-read CLAUDE.md and confirm it contains only project-specific facts supported by local files.

## Step 6: Restart Notice

End your reply with this exact notice so the user doesn't miss it:

> ⚠️ CLAUDE.md was created/updated. ggcoder loads it at startup, so **exit and restart ggcoder** (\`/quit\` then run \`ggcoder\` again) before continuing. Without a restart, I won't see the new context.`,

- package.json -> Extract lint, typecheck scripts
- pyproject.toml -> Use configured mypy, pylint/ruff commands
- go.mod -> Use configured go vet/gofmt/staticcheck commands
- Cargo.toml -> Use configured cargo clippy/fmt commands

Prefer existing project scripts. If you must synthesize a command from tool conventions, verify the current CLI flags against official docs first.

## Step 2: Generate /commit Command

Create the directory \`.gg/commands/\` if it doesn't exist, then write \`.gg/commands/commit.md\`:

\`\`\`markdown
---
name: commit
description: Run checks, commit with AI message, and push
---

1. Run quality checks:
   [PROJECT-SPECIFIC LINT/TYPECHECK COMMANDS]
   Fix ALL errors before continuing. Use auto-fix commands where available.

2. Review changes: run git status and git diff --staged and git diff

3. Stage relevant files with git add (specific files, not -A)

4. Generate a commit message:
   - Start with verb (Add/Update/Fix/Remove/Refactor)
   - Be specific and concise, one line preferred

5. Commit and push:
   git commit -m "your generated message"
   git push
\`\`\`

Replace [PROJECT-SPECIFIC LINT/TYPECHECK COMMANDS] with the actual commands.

Keep the command file under 20 lines.

## Step 3: Confirm

Report that /commit is now available with quality checks and AI-generated commit messages, and mention which local scripts/docs verified the commands.`,

    prompt: `Compare the code you just created or modified in this conversation against real-world implementations using the \`mcp__kencode-search__searchCode\` tool.

You already know what you just built. For each file you created or modified, use \`mcp__kencode-search__searchCode\` to search for how real projects implement the same patterns. Look at the specific APIs, hooks, functions, and architecture you used.

If you find something consistently done differently across real codebases, or something commonly included that you left out, report it:

\`\`\`
[MISSING/DIVERGENT/INCOMPLETE] file:line - What it is
Wrote: What was implemented
Real-world: What real projects do instead/additionally
Evidence: kencode-search - pattern seen in X out of Y repos searched

Style preferences and subjective improvements are not valid findings. Only report things backed by clear kencode-search evidence across multiple repos.

If the code aligns well with real-world patterns, say so. That's a good outcome.`,

    description: "Recommend useful skills",
    prompt: `# Skills Audit: Find useful skills for this project

Analyze this project and recommend skills from the open ecosystem that would make **working on this project more efficient, easier, and safer**. That is the goal, full stop. Every recommendation must pass the test: does this skill save real time, lower real cognitive load, or prevent real mistakes for someone working on THIS project, repeatedly?

Ranked by real impact, not volume.

This project could be anything — a web app, a CLI, a mobile app, a game, firmware, a data pipeline, a library, a scientific tool. Do not assume a stack. Let the codebase tell you what it is, then decide what to look for.

## Phase 1: Understand what this project is

Read just enough to know what kind of project this is. Look at whichever signals actually apply:

- Build / manifest files: \`package.json\`, \`pyproject.toml\`, \`Cargo.toml\`, \`go.mod\`, \`pubspec.yaml\`, \`Podfile\`, Xcode project, Gradle build, \`*.csproj\`, \`CMakeLists.txt\`, Unity/Unreal project files, Makefile — whatever exists.
- Any README, CLAUDE.md, or AGENTS.md.
- Top-level directory layout and obvious entry points.
- Any CI config, lockfile, or config directory that hints at workflow.

**Do NOT read source code yet.** You need only a coarse answer to: what kind of project is this, what platform/stack/language, what stage (greenfield vs mature), and what does the surrounding workflow look like (build, test, release, distribute, deploy — whatever applies for THIS project type).

## Phase 2: Decide which domains to investigate

Based on Phase 1, pick 4–6 domain slices that represent the **recurring work someone actually does on this project** — not abstract "areas of the codebase," but the real activities that eat time, attention, or trust. Do not use a fixed template. The right domains for a Rust CLI are different from an iOS app, a Unity game, a Django backend, a Kubernetes operator, or an ML notebook.

Illustrative only (not prescriptive):

- Web app → shipping features, API changes, handling data safely, deploys
- Mobile app → building screens, store releases, platform quirks, crash & accessibility triage
- CLI tool → adding commands, packaging & distribution, user-facing UX, error handling
- Game → adding content, platform ports, perf passes, build pipeline
- Library → designing public APIs, cutting releases, downstream compatibility, docs/examples
- Data / ML → running experiments, pipeline orchestration, reproducibility, serving models
- Embedded → adding peripherals, size/memory passes, flashing, hardware bring-up

**Announce your chosen domains to the user in one line before spawning agents**, so they can see what you're looking at (e.g. \`Domains: adding content, platform ports, perf passes, build pipeline\`).

## Phase 3: Parallel sweep

Spawn one sub-agent per domain you chose, in parallel using the subagent tool (call it N times in a single response, one task per domain). Each explores its assigned domain and returns skill-worthy opportunities.

**Skill-worthy means**: a recurring activity someone will do on THIS project — shipping, reviewing, migrating, debugging, onboarding, whatever applies — where a reusable instruction set would make it **faster** (efficient), **lower-effort** (easier), or **less likely to break something** (safer). The test is: will this skill save real time, reduce real cognitive load, or prevent real mistakes, repeatedly, on this project? If no, drop it. A domain returning zero candidates is a valid outcome.

Each sub-agent must return candidates in this exact shape, nothing else:

\`\`\`
[domain] — candidate title
Why: one sentence on the real friction observed in THIS project
Search terms: 2–3 keywords the parent should feed to find-skills
\`\`\`

Don't invent. Don't pad.

## Phase 4: Ecosystem search

After all sub-agents complete, use the **skill** tool to invoke the \`find-skills\` skill. Feed it the aggregated candidate list with search terms. Let find-skills drive discovery across skills.sh, vercel-labs/agent-skills, and anthropics/skills.

For each candidate, record the best 0–1 ecosystem match: skill name, source repo URL, and enough evidence from the skill README/source to prove it fits this project. If no fit exists, record "no match". **Do NOT install anything yet.**

## Phase 5: Prioritized recommendation

Rank every candidate that returned a real match by **crucial factor** — a 0–100% score combining:

- **Frequency** — how often someone will do this work on this project
- **Lift** — how much the skill makes it faster (efficient), lower-effort (easier), or safer (fewer mistakes, broken builds, bad releases) per hit
- **Fit** — how well the ecosystem match actually matches this project

Present highest first, in this exact format:

\`\`\`
# Skills Audit

1. <skill-name> — 92%
   Benefit: <one sentence on what it does for this project>
   Source: <repo URL>
   Scope: project

2. <skill-name> — 78%
   Benefit: …
   Source: …
   Scope: project
\`\`\`

Cap the list at 8. If you'd list more, you're padding. Default scope is \`project\` per find-skills' rules; only mark \`global\` when the skill is genuinely cross-cutting.

If strong candidates had no ecosystem match, list them at the bottom:

\`\`\`
## Gaps worth authoring

- <candidate title> — <why it matters for this project> — consider scaffolding a custom SKILL.md
\`\`\`

## Phase 6: Wait for the user

After presenting the list, ask which (if any) to install. Install nothing without explicit confirmation. Once confirmed, hand off to find-skills to perform the actual install.`,

  {
    name: "setup",
    aliases: ["setup-project"],
    description: "Audit project setup",
    prompt: `Audit this project across six categories and report gaps. **Do not fix anything yet.** Wait for me to choose what to address after the report.

Language-agnostic and project-agnostic — adapt findings to the languages and stack actually present. Ignore categories that don't apply (e.g. skip CI for a local-only scratchpad).

## Categories

### 1. Project hygiene

- \`.gitignore\` present and covers the active language(s)?
- \`README.md\` present with at least install + run instructions?
- License file present (if this looks like a public/shareable project)?
- \`.editorconfig\` present?
- Git initialized? (\`.git\` directory exists)

### 2. Toolchain version pinning

- Language version pinned in a canonical file: \`.nvmrc\` / \`package.json#engines\` (Node), \`.python-version\` / \`pyproject.toml#requires-python\` (Python), \`rust-toolchain.toml\` (Rust), the \`go\` line in \`go.mod\`, \`.ruby-version\` (Ruby), etc.
- Lockfile present and committed? (\`package-lock.json\`, \`pnpm-lock.yaml\`, \`yarn.lock\`, \`bun.lockb\`, \`uv.lock\`, \`poetry.lock\`, \`Cargo.lock\`, \`go.sum\`, \`Gemfile.lock\`, \`composer.lock\`)

### 3. Code quality tooling

For each active language, check that a formatter, linter, and (where applicable) type checker are configured:
- **Formatter**: Prettier / ruff format / gofmt (built-in) / rustfmt (built-in) / clang-format / etc.
- **Linter**: ESLint / Ruff / golangci-lint / Clippy / etc. — with a reasonable strictness preset
- **Type checker** (statically-typed langs only): tsc strict, Pyright strict, mypy strict
- **Test framework**: vitest / jest / pytest / go test / cargo test / rspec / etc.

Report which are present, missing, or configured below the pack's strictness recommendation.

### 4. Verify pipeline

- Are \`lint\` / \`typecheck\` / \`format:check\` / \`test\` (or language-equivalent) wired as runnable commands? (scripts in \`package.json\`, \`pyproject.toml\`, a \`Makefile\`, or \`justfile\`)
- Pre-commit hook configured? (\`.husky/\`, \`pre-commit\` framework, \`lefthook\`, etc.) — nice-to-have, not required.
- CI config present? (\`.github/workflows/\`, \`.gitlab-ci.yml\`, \`.circleci/\`, etc.)

### 5. Style pack alignment

"Active style packs" refers specifically to the per-language sub-sections inside the **Language Style Packs** section in your system prompt (e.g. \`### TypeScript\`, \`### Python\`, \`### Go\`). It does **NOT** include the cross-cutting \`### Agent-Written Code\` preamble that sits above them — those are guidelines for how code is *written*, not project-scaffolding to audit. It also does **NOT** include Skills (\`.gg/skills/\`) or any other extension category. If the Language Style Packs section is absent or empty, **skip this entire section entirely** — do not substitute Skills or any other concept.

When per-language packs are present, compare the project against each pack's **Tooling** bullet and the system prompt's **Verification** commands. For tool recommendations or config semantics, verify against official docs when local files are ambiguous:
- Tooling: which strict-mode flags or lint-rule presets does the pack recommend that the project is missing? (e.g. \`tsconfig\` missing \`noUncheckedIndexedAccess\`, \`pyproject\` missing \`[tool.ruff]\`, Go project missing \`golangci-lint\` config).
- Dependencies: list which pack-mentioned libs (Zod, Pydantic, thiserror, anyhow, etc.) the project uses, has an equivalent for, or lacks. **Observation only — no recommendation to install.**

### 6. Documentation hygiene

- \`CLAUDE.md\` or \`AGENTS.md\` present?
- Public API documented? (top-level docstrings, type signatures, or README examples)
- Architecture doc for non-trivial projects? (\`ARCHITECTURE.md\`, \`docs/architecture/\`, ADRs)

## How to investigate

- Read the project root + obvious config locations (\`./\`, \`.github/\`, \`.husky/\`, \`docs/\`).
- Don't recurse into \`node_modules\`, \`dist\`, \`build\`, \`target\`, vendored folders.
- Use \`ls\`, \`read\`, \`find\` (with name patterns) — do not \`grep\` source code for this audit; it's about scaffolding, not code review.
- Cap at ~20 file reads total. If a file is huge (e.g. \`pnpm-lock.yaml\`), don't read its body — presence is what matters.

## Output format

A single Markdown report, organized by category. Within each category, mark each item as one of:
- \`[OK]\` — present and reasonable
- \`[GAP]\` — missing or misconfigured; safe to add/fix
- \`[INFO]\` — observation only, no action implied
- \`[N/A]\` — doesn't apply to this project (omit from output if obvious)

Keep each line to one sentence. No prose paragraphs.

At the end:

\`\`\`
## Summary

<N> gaps in hygiene, <N> in tooling, <N> in verify pipeline, <N> in style-pack alignment.

Which (if any) would you like me to fix? Options:
- A) Create a Goal for all [GAP] items that are safe + additive (no overwrites)
- B) Create a Goal for a category: hygiene / tooling / verify / style-pack alignment
- C) Create a Goal for specific items — tell me which
- D) None — just the report
\`\`\`

## Rules

- **Report only.** No edits, no installs, no commits without explicit user confirmation after the report.
- **Goal handoff for fixes.** If the user chooses A, B, or C, do not fix directly. Create one durable Goal with standalone worker tasks for the selected gap or tightly coupled gap groups. Each worker prompt must include the gap, affected files/configs, safe-additive constraints, implementation instructions, project verification commands, and instructions to verify relevant tool/config semantics against official docs before marking the Goal task complete. Use kencode search only for code-level examples, not as proof of scaffolding requirements. After creating the Goal, tell the user exactly: "Goal created. Press CTRL + G to open the Goal pane and run it." Do not begin executing it unless the user explicitly starts the Goal.
- **No code refactors recommended.** This audit is about scaffolding/tooling, not code review. Use \`/scan\` or \`/verify\` for code-level findings.
- **No dependency installations in the report.** Listing them as observations is fine; recommending installation is not — that's the user's call.
- **Skip empty categories.** If a category has no findings, omit it.
- **Adapt to scale.** A 50-line script doesn't need CI, a license, or an ARCHITECTURE.md. Use judgment.
- **Brand-new empty project**: report "Empty project — nothing to audit. To bootstrap, tell me the stack you want and I'll scaffold from scratch." and stop.`,
