/**
 * One-line prompt hints for each tool, shown in the system prompt's Tools
 * section. Full parameter docs live on each tool's JSON schema description
 * (sent separately via the tool definition), so these hints stay short.
 *
 * Hints exist ONLY for tools whose correct usage is NOT obvious from their
 * schema description alone. The core file/nav/exec tools (read/write/edit/
 * bash/find/grep/ls) deliberately have NO hint: an ablation (experiments/
 * prompt-bench, Opus n=12) showed dropping their hints did not change tool
 * selection — the schema description already carries when/how to use them.
 * Cross-tool preferences for those tools live in TOOL_STEERING instead.
